We laugh and mock the rich idiot who gets trotted out on TV, who relentlessly markets himself as the ultimate arbiter of value and quality (Trump Vodka, Trump Steaks) and the ultimate strategist and commander (Trump University).

They may say mean things, but their wrath is toothless precisely because nothing they say matters.\n",

All that matters is that each and every \"side\" yells loudly to gain the approval of those already in their corner. And Trump cannot abide by the fact that a certain subset of the media will never be like Sean Hannity is to him -- fawning, adoring, lickspittles who never say anything bad. His brain, formed over 70 years of not having to deal with the real world thanks to his family's position, money, and connections, cannot handle the fact that no matter what he does, he is going to be harshly and rightly criticized for what he did.\n",
